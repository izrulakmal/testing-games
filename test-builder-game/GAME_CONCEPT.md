# 🧪 Test Plan Builder - Game Concept

## 🎮 Game Overview
**Test Plan Builder** is an interactive drag-and-drop game that teaches software testing fundamentals through hands-on test planning and bug discovery.

## 🎯 Core Mechanics

### 1. Test Plan Building (Drag & Drop)
- **Test Steps Panel**: Left side contains draggable test step cards
- **Test Plan Canvas**: Center area where players build their test sequence
- **Test Categories**:
  - 🔍 **Input Validation** (Check empty fields, special characters, etc.)
  - 🔒 **Security Testing** (SQL injection, XSS, authentication)
  - 🎨 **UI Testing** (Layout, responsiveness, accessibility)
  - ⚡ **Performance** (Load time, memory usage)
  - 🔄 **Workflow Testing** (User flows, edge cases)

### 2. Bug Discovery & Fixing
- **Run Tests**: Execute test plan to reveal bugs in the "application"
- **Bug Types**:
  - 🐛 Minor (UI glitches) - 10 points
  - 🐞 Major (Functionality issues) - 25 points
  - 🦗 Critical (Security/Data loss) - 50 points
- **Fix Mechanics**: Click on discovered bugs to fix them
- **Coverage Meter**: Shows test coverage percentage

### 3. Progression System
- **Levels**: 5+ levels with increasing complexity
- **Scoring**:
  - Points for each bug found and fixed
  - Bonus for 100% test coverage
  - Multiplier for optimal test sequences
  - Time bonus for efficiency
- **Unlockables**: New test types and applications to test

### 4. Visual Feedback
- ✨ Sparkle effects when tests pass
- 💥 Explosion effects when bugs are found
- 🎊 Celebration animations for level completion
- 📊 Real-time stats and progress bars

## 🎨 Visual Theme
- **Bright Colors**: Vibrant gradients (purple, blue, pink, green)
- **Modern UI**: Card-based design with shadows and hover effects
- **Smooth Animations**: Drag effects, transitions, particle systems
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and tablet

## 📚 Educational Value
Players learn:
- Importance of comprehensive test planning
- Different types of software testing
- How test coverage affects bug detection
- Prioritization of test cases
- Real-world testing scenarios
